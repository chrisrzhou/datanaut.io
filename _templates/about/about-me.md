## About Me

### Dataverse In a Nutshell
>   Incoming transmission: ...

Greetings!

My name is Chris Zhou, and I am a young *data-hungry* business intelligence analyst with a deep interest in data 
organization and visualizations.

I enjoy building tools and visualizations *from scratch*, and have a curious mind to constantly dig deeper to uncover 
simpler *abstractions* of seemingly complex problems.  I highly *dislike inefficiency* and repetitive wastes in designs 
and processes, and I strongly believe it is worth the effort to master efficient techniques to better my personal life
and make equivalent impacts on other people.

My ordered preference of hacking tools include: `Python > Javascript > R`.

### Tell me more...
>   We require more minerals!

Curiosity and an obsessive inner drive to finding simpler abstractions of complex problems has embarked me on a journey
of "programming" [autodidactism][].  Despite graduating from Rice University with a degree in Physics and Mathematics, 
I have stumbled onto the new planets of **Programming**, **DataManagement**, and **Visualizations**.

The voyage was initially rough and foreign, but 2-3 years of drifting and exploring in this grand Dataverse has made
me fall in love with all the material, frameworks, and best practices that I "stumbled" through self-learning.

I strongly believe that a combination of interest, personal-drive, *practice* and ease-of-access to coding 
resources in today's era (*thank you [Google][] and [Stackoverflow][]*) are the key catalysts for learning fast.

Just as I have received these gifts from the community, I feel much obliged to *contribute back*, and I hope this 
website could inspire a few datanauts to venture into the unknown and come back as passionate pioneers.

Spare time is hard to come by these days.  There are too many interesting Dataverses to explore and map out.  
Whenever possible, I try to make time for playing PC games (Hearthstone, Heroes of the Storm, some DotA), as well as 
practicing ink-drawings.

I live with my wonderful fiance, whom is also a data master of sorts in her quest in researching [osteosarcoma][] 
cancer.  We share our residence with our two awesome cats, `Metal` and `Sneakers`.
